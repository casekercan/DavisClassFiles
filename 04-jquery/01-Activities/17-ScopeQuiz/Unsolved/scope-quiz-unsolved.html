<!-- ## Instructions

* Spend a few moments studying the code with the person sitting next to you.

* Then run the program in the browser.

* Once you run the program, you'll find that Code Block 1 leads to different alerts than Code Block 2.

* Ask your partner which Code Block is behaving the way you would expect.

* Then work with your partner to try and identify the specific difference that is causing the issue with the faulty block.

* Once you spot the issue, try to explain to your partner why JavaScript is handling these Code Blocks differently. -->

    // Run this program. Then turn to the person next to you and answer the following questions:
    // 1. What is the difference (in output) between Situation 1 and Situation 2?
    // 2. Why are the alert messages different? (Hint: Look for syntax differences)

    // Situation 1
    // ------------------------------------------

    function a1() {
      myVar1 = 5 - 3;

    }

    function b1() {
