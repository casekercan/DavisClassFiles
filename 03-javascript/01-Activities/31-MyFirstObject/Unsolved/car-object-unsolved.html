<!-- ### Instructions

* With a partner, spend the next few moments studying the code in the file above.

* Then write code below each comment to log the relevant information about the provided `car` object.

* **BONUS:** If you finish early, create a brand new object of your own. Slack out a snippet of the code to the class when you are done. Be creative! -->

      // The car's make?

      // The car's model?

      // The car's mileage?

      // How would we run the car's driveToWork method?

      // How would we run the car's driveAroundWorld method?

      // How would we run the getTuneUp method?
